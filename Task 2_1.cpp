Explanation on Reliability

The proposed algorithm utilizes robots' active locations to compare them with the past ones in order to recognize possible violent areas between them.
It determines the first intersection of the robotsâ€™ paths, the intersection is called the conflict region with care to avoid ignoring any overlap.
In this way, the approach guarantees that the conflicts are managed at the earliest time and therefore, the possibilities of the collision risk is reduced.
Through the evaluation of all possible areas of crossing on the paths as a way of exploring existing regions, the algorithm achieves a remarkable level of reliability and quality assurance in possibly all cases of interest.

Explanation on Safety

The movement planning algorithm also attacks the safety principles well, as it does not allow robots to position themselves in conflict regions at the same time.
If a robot conflict is identified for example, it means that one of the measures such as stopping one robot in order to avoid a clash could be implemented.
All this enables the system conflicting human interference to resolve conflicts in an appropriate manner and to keep operations as smooth. 
Well-structured application of the data set and segmentation of the algorithm will enable the use of additional triangulating or even better strategies such as robot delivery prioritization based on the most needed task or the most efficient one to ensure safe and efficient movement.
